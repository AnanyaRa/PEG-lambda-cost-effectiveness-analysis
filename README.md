## Abstract
### Context 
Although the COVID-19 caseload in the United States has decreased significantly, the
need for effective treatments continues despite the existence of a few promising drugs. Recently,
a phase 3 trial conducted in Brazil and Canada showed that pegylated interferon lambda
(PEG-lambda) could prevent hospitalization/emergency department (ED) visits in COVID-19
patients at a level matching that of Paxlovid, the current standard of care, with no known side
effects. Despite the strong evidence, the FDA is refusing to approve, or even authorize the
emergency use, of PEG-lambda.
### Objective 
To examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of five different allocation
strategies of the PEG-lambda drug, stratified by vaccine status and risk for severe disease, for
COVID-19 in the United States
### Design
A decision tree model from a limited healthcare sector perspective, with a hypothetical
COVID-19-positive, US adult population.
### Main Outcome Measures
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of dollars per
hospitalization/ED visit averted, with a willingness to pay threshold of $50-500K per
hospitalization averted.
### Results
Providing PEG-lambda to unvaccinated patients at high risk for severe COVID-19 was
cost-saving under the scenarios considered in this model. The cost-effectiveness of other
allocation strategies, including those for vaccinated adults and those at lower risk for severe
COVID-19, depends on treatment cost and effectiveness, willingness to pay thresholds and
hospitalization costs.
